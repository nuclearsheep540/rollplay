## **5 Days of Development Progress & First Production Build Since 2024**
*Including this new patch notes page of the site...*

### **Adventure Logging System**
- **Real-time Adventure Log**: Live-updating: chronicle of your D&D session that all players can reference in real-time with our "Adventure Log" system
- **Comprehensive Game History**: Every chat message, dice roll, and game action is now automatically logged and persists throughout different sessions
- **Smart Message Grouping**: Consecutive messages from the same player are visually grouped for cleaner reading and reduce log clutter
- **Custom UI**: Color-coded messages with custom playerer colors, and special Dungeon Master log styling in the Adventure Log
- **Cleanup Fucntions**: Clear any system messages from the log or wipe the Adventure Log slate clean with built-in functionality

### **Player Color Customization**
- **Choose Your Color**: Players are now colour coded! You can now select a "seat color" using a color picker
- **Real-time Sync**: Color changes appear instantly for all players in the game and applies custom colours across the Adenture Log
- **Persistent Colors**: Your chosen color is saved (to the seat position) and restored when you rejoin sessions. A 5 second cooldown is added to prevent spamming 

### **Advanced DM Prompt System**
- **Individual Player Prompts**: DMs can prompt specific players for ability checks, saving throws, attack rolls, or custom rolls
- **Mass Initiative Prompting**: One-click initiative prompts for all players at combat start
- **Active Prompt Tracking**: DM Control Center shows exactly how many prompts are pending, and can allow the DM to retract any roll prompts
- **Smart Auto-clearing**: Prompts automatically clear when players complete their rolls

### **Enhanced Dice Rolling**
- **Complete Dice Set**: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D100 with visual dice selection
- **Roll Modifiers**: Add bonuses/penalties (+3, -2, etc.) to any roll
- **Context-Aware Rolling**: Rolls show what they're for ("Strength Check", "Initiative", etc.)
- **Turn-Based Integration**: Dice panel adapts based on whose turn it is in combat (combat turns to be implemented)

### **Room Management System**
- **Ya Banned!**: Dungeon Masters can now kick people out of the game, so be on your best behaviour!
- **Musical Chairs**: Dungeon Masters can now add or remove seats from the game, in case anyone wants to make an one-off appearance
- **Zoom... Enhance**: New scaling feature in the UI for users to change... well, the UI scale! (This is just for your display of course)

## **Under the Hood**

- **Cleaned up the Event-Driven Design**: Refactored clearer separation of game logic, makes adding new features easier
- **Prompt Management**: Central location for managing all player dice prompts
- **Message History Control**: Separate options to clear system messages vs. all adventure log entries
- **Visual Status Indicators**: See at-a-glance which players have active prompts
- **MongoDB Integration**: Professional database storage for game sessions and adventure logs
    - Message limiting grouped by active_session with real-time truncating of historical data
    - Optimized Mongo queries and indexing for fast response times with the message system
