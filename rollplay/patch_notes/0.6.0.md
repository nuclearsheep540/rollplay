## üèóÔ∏è Major Architectural Changes

#### WebSocket Code Organization
- **NEW:** Created dedicated `websocket_handlers/` module for all WebSocket-related code
- **MOVED:** Extracted WebSocket event handling from `app.py` into centralized `WebsocketEvent` class
- **MOVED:** Connection management to dedicated `websocket_handlers/connection_manager.py`
- **MOVED:** WebSocket routing to `websocket_handlers/app_websocket.py` using dependency injection pattern

#### Code Structure Improvements
- **REFACTORED:** Implemented `WebsocketEventResult` pattern to solve scope management issues with shared variables
- **REMOVED:** Duplicate `add_adventure_log` helper functions across multiple files
- **ENHANCED:** `AdventureLogService.add_log_entry()` method to handle LogType enums directly with better defaults
- **IMPROVED:** Separation of concerns between HTTP routes and WebSocket handlers


#### WebSocket Event Handling
- **FIXED:** Eliminated duplicate `websocket.accept()` calls that were causing immediate disconnections (code 1006)
- **IMPROVED:** Event handler return pattern using result objects for multiple optional messages
- **ENHANCED:** Error handling and debugging capabilities for WebSocket connections

#### Database & Logging
- **OPTIMIZED:** Adventure log service integration with WebSocket events
- **REMOVED:** Code duplication in logging helpers
- **IMPROVED:** LogType enum handling throughout the application

#### Development Experience
- **ADDED:** Better error messages and debugging output for WebSocket issues
- **IMPROVED:** Module organization prevents circular import dependencies
- **ENHANCED:** Maintainability through cleaner separation of concerns

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- **FIXED:** WebSocket connection stability issues causing immediate disconnections
- **FIXED:** Undefined variable errors after refactoring
- **FIXED:** Import path conflicts with Python's built-in `websockets` package
- **FIXED:** Frontend WebSocket function availability issues

## üîí Legal & Compliance
- **ADDED:** GPL-3.0 license headers to all new source files
- **UPDATED:** Copyright notices for 2025
- **MAINTAINED:** License compliance across refactored modules

## üìã Migration Notes
- WebSocket event handlers have been moved from `app.py` to dedicated modules
- All duplicate logging helpers have been consolidated into the service layer
- Import paths for WebSocket-related functionality have changed
- No breaking changes to the frontend WebSocket API

This release represents a significant improvement in code organization and maintainability while maintaining all existing functionality. The WebSocket architecture is now properly separated from HTTP routes, making future development and debugging much easier.
