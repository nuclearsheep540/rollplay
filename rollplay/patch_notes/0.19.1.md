## User Feedback 3 & Bugfixes

This release addresses several user feedback points, fixes the production magic link issue, and introduces improvements to the UX and notification systems.

## Updates and Improvements

### Bug Fixes:
- Magic link issue in production: Resolved by adding missing /api/auth/ routes to the production NGINX config.
- Campaign deletion validation: Now checks all non-finished sessions (not just active ones), preventing deletion of campaigns with inactive sessions.
- Session start notification: Updated notification wording and changed navigation from the Sessions tab to the Campaigns tab, with auto-expansion of the relevant campaign drawer.

### Notification System Enhancements:
- Personalized notifications: Self-triggered notifications now display "You" (e.g., session start notifications show "You started the session" for the host).
- Campaign notification deep-linking: Clicking on campaign notifications will now automatically expand the relevant campaign drawer.
- Unified notification components: Combined and streamlined NotificationPanel and NotificationBell components; now passes userId for "You" substitution in notifications.

### UX/UI Improvements:
#### Improved terminology and labels:
- Changed "Username" label to "Account Name" in the account creation modal.

#### Campaign interface redesign:
- Moved the invite button from the campaign tile to the campaign drawer, under the "Campaign Members" heading.
- Added a "Campaign Controls" section in the drawer for hosts (including "Configure" and "Delete Campaign" buttons).
- Simplified campaign tile to display only the title and description.

#### Campaign edit modal updates:
- Added the ability to edit the current session’s name through the campaign edit modal.
- Improved consistency of modal styling by aligning campaign create/edit modals with the invite modal (e.g., larger width, updated header/footer sections).

### Drawer updates:
- Standardized campaign drawer section spacing using mt-8 pt-6 border-t patterns instead of spacer divs.
- Adjusted asymmetric drawer padding for consistency (was 56px top / 32px bottom; now both symmetric).
