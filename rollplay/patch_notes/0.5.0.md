## **Missing Core Dice Mechanics & System Improvements**
*Fixing previous critical fails in essential D&D functionality...*

### **Advanced Dice Rolling**
- **Advantage/Disadvantage Support**: Essential D&D mechanics now implemented with dual dice rolling
- **Cleaner Roll Display**: Removed raw roll values from roll messages, showing only calculated results
- **Responsive Dice Modal**: Resized dice action modal to properly fit 1080p displays

### **Smart Prompt Management**

### **Enhanced Lobby System**
- **Universal Player Visibility**: Shows all connected users, whether in party or not
- **Smart Display**: Hides when you're in the active party to reduce clutter
- **Connection Status**: Displays disconnected users for better session management
