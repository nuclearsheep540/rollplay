the horizontal initiative doesnt display when combat is initiated - is this because it required inititive rolled?
need to continue fixing the CSS display order of adventure log messages

move party management into it's own "moderator controls" section

need to make sure there's a log broadcast for rolling for initiative
    is there a better system to ensure any roll command issues this? individual rolls work so all init should to
