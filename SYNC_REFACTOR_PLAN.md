# Audio Sync Logic Refactor Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to refactor the audio synchronization logic in the Rollplay application. The refactor addresses critical code duplication, bug prevention, and sets up the foundation for advanced DJ-style features.

## Current Problems Identified

### 1. **Logic Duplication (100+ lines)**
- `AudioMixerPanel.js` has identical sync logic in 3 places:
  - `handlePlay`: 54 lines of sync detection and track building
  - `handlePause`: 20 lines of sync detection  
  - `handleStop`: 20 lines of sync detection

### 2. **Inconsistent Behavior**
- **Mixed Sync Bug**: Play works for AB/BA combinations, but pause/stop don't
- **Root Cause**: Play uses routing-based pairing, pause/stop use track-letter-based pairing
- **Example**: Music A + Ambient B playing, pause Music A → incorrectly looks for Ambient A instead of Ambient B

### 3. **Complex State Dependencies**
Each handler needs access to: `trackRouting`, `syncMode`, `remoteTrackStates`, `pendingOperations`
Plus validation, WebSocket sending, error handling - repeated 3 times.

### 4. **Future Feature Blocker**
User requested "smart stop conflicting tracks" feature (DJ crossfader UX) would require duplicating logic 3 more times.

## Proposed Solution: Centralized Sync Logic

### Core Concept
Create a single pure function that returns "what tracks should be affected" for any operation:

```javascript
export const getSyncTargets = (
  clickedTrackId,      // 'audio_channel_1A' 
  trackRouting,        // { music: 'A', ambient: 'A' }
  syncMode,            // true/false
  remoteTrackStates,   // Full state object
  options = {}         // { forceIndependent, stopConflicting }
) => {
  // Returns: Array of complete track objects ready for WebSocket
  // [{ channelId, filename, looping, volume, playbackState, currentTime }]
}
```

### Handler Simplification
```javascript
// Before: 85 lines of complex sync logic
// After: ~15 lines using centralized function
const handlePlay = async (channel) => {
  // ... validation (unchanged)
  
  const targets = getSyncTargets(channel.channelId, trackRouting, syncMode, remoteTrackStates);
  const shouldResume = targets.some(t => t.playbackState === 'paused');
  
  if (shouldResume) {
    sendRemoteAudioResumeTracks(targets);
  } else {
    sendRemoteAudioPlayTracks(targets);
  }
};
```

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Files Analyzed

#### **AudioMixerPanel.js - The Problem Zone**
- **handlePlay**: Lines 197-250 (54 lines of sync logic)
- **handlePause**: Lines 288-307 (20 lines of sync logic) 
- **handleStop**: Lines 324-343 (20 lines of sync logic)
- **Complex Dependencies**: trackRouting, syncMode, remoteTrackStates, pendingOperations
- **Inconsistent Track Building**: Different WebSocket message patterns

#### **useUnifiedAudio.js - The Missed Opportunity**
- **Current Role**: Individual track operations only (`playRemoteTrack`, `pauseRemoteTrack`, `stopRemoteTrack`)
- **Missing**: No understanding of sync relationships
- **State Management**: Already holds all data centralized sync logic needs
- **Perfect Location**: Should be authoritative source for "what tracks work together"

#### **AudioTrack.js - The Innocent Bystander**  
- **Zero Impact**: Pure UI component that just calls event handlers
- **No Changes Required**: Will continue working with refactored handlers

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Create Centralized Function (Safe Foundation)**

**Goal:** Add new function without breaking anything

**Location:** Add to `useUnifiedAudio.js` as pure function

**Benefits:**
- Pure function, no side effects
- Can be thoroughly tested before integration  
- Doesn't break existing code
- Easy rollback if issues found

### **Phase 2: Migrate handlePlay (Highest Value)**

**Goal:** Replace most complex handler with centralized logic

**Impact:** 85 lines → ~15 lines

**Why First:**
- Most complex logic (biggest win)
- Has resume vs play decision logic (good test case)
- Complete state building (validates function design)
- Most likely to reveal edge cases early

### **Phase 3: Migrate handlePause & handleStop (Easy Wins)**

**Goal:** Replace remaining duplicate sync logic

**Impact:** Each goes from ~20 lines to ~5 lines

**Why Second:**
- Simpler logic (lower risk)
- Validates function works for all operations
- Removes remaining duplication

### **Phase 4: Add Smart Stop Feature (Future Enhancement)**

**Goal:** Implement DJ crossfader UX improvement

**Enhancement:** Extend function with conflict detection
```javascript
const targets = getSyncTargets(clickedTrackId, trackRouting, syncMode, remoteTrackStates, {
  stopConflicting: true // Stop conflicting tracks when starting new combination
});
```

## Independence Cases Handled

### **Critical Edge Cases That Must Work:**

1. **Sync Mode OFF** 
   ```javascript
   syncMode = false
   // Must return single track (independent playback)
   ```

2. **SFX Tracks (Always Independent)**
   ```javascript
   channel.type === 'sfx'
   // Must return single track even when syncMode = true
   ```

3. **Manual Override (Future)**
   ```javascript
   options.forceIndependent = true
   // Allow playing individual tracks even when sync is on
   ```

### **Testing Matrix:**

| Scenario | syncMode | trackType | Expected Result |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Normal sync off | false | music | Single track |
| Normal sync off | false | ambient | Single track |
| SFX with sync on | true | sfx | Single track |
| SFX with sync off | false | sfx | Single track |
| Music A, sync AA | true | music | Two tracks (Music A + Ambient A) |
| Music A, sync AB | true | music | Two tracks (Music A + Ambient B) |
| Ambient B, sync BB | true | ambient | Two tracks (Music B + Ambient B) |
| Force independent | true | music | Single track (override) |

## Risk Assessment

### **LOW RISK Areas:**
- **AudioTrack.js:** No changes required
- **Backend:** No changes required  
- **WebSocket protocol:** No changes required
- **State management:** No new state, same dependencies

### **MEDIUM RISK Areas:**
- **Logic migration:** Must ensure centralized function handles all edge cases
- **Testing:** New function needs comprehensive test coverage

### **HIGH VALUE Returns:**
- **Bug prevention:** Impossible to have sync inconsistencies  
- **Code reduction:** ~80 lines of duplication removed
- **Feature velocity:** Smart stop feature becomes trivial
- **Maintainability:** Single source of truth for sync logic

## Success Metrics

### **Phase 1 Success:**
- ✅ Function handles all test scenarios correctly
- ✅ No impact on existing functionality
- ✅ Clear, testable, documented

### **Phase 2 Success:**
- ✅ handlePlay behavior identical to before
- ✅ All sync scenarios work (AA, BB, AB, BA)
- ✅ Independent playback unchanged
- ✅ Code reduced from 85 lines to ~15 lines

### **Phase 3 Success:**
- ✅ handlePause/handleStop use same function
- ✅ Mixed sync bug permanently fixed
- ✅ All handlers use consistent logic

### **Phase 4 Success:**
- ✅ Smart stop feature implemented with zero handler changes
- ✅ DJ-style UX: changing sync settings auto-stops conflicting tracks

## Migration Strategy

### **Risk Mitigation:**
- **Feature flag:** Easy to toggle between old/new logic
- **Logging:** Compare old vs new behavior in real-time
- **Rollback plan:** Keep old functions commented during transition

### **Testing Strategy:**
```javascript
// Unit tests for all scenarios:
describe('getSyncTargets', () => {
  test('sync off returns single track');
  test('SFX always returns single track');
  test('matched sync AA returns two tracks');
  test('mixed sync AB returns two tracks');
  test('missing sync pair returns single track');
  test('forceIndependent option works');
});
```

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1:** 1-2 hours (pure function + tests)
- **Phase 2:** 2-3 hours (careful migration + testing)
- **Phase 3:** 1 hour (straightforward duplication removal)
- **Phase 4:** 2-4 hours (depending on smart stop complexity)

**Total:** One solid development session, with natural break points between phases.

## Benefits Summary

### **Immediate Benefits:**
1. **Eliminate Mixed Sync Bug:** Permanently fixed by consistent logic
2. **Reduce Code Complexity:** 100+ lines → ~30 lines across all handlers
3. **Improve Maintainability:** Single source of truth for sync decisions
4. **Prevent Future Bugs:** Impossible to have inconsistent sync behavior

### **Future Benefits:**
1. **Enable DJ Features:** Smart crossfading, conflict detection
2. **Easy A/B Testing:** Compare different sync strategies in one place
3. **Feature Velocity:** New sync modes become trivial to add
4. **Architectural Improvement:** Proper separation of concerns

## Recommendation

**Proceed with High Confidence** - This refactor represents exactly the right abstraction. It centralizes complex "what tracks work together" logic while keeping simple "send WebSocket message" logic in the UI layer.

The refactor is **additive and non-breaking**, making it low risk with very high value returns.
