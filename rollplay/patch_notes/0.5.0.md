## **Adding in core dice rolling logic I totally missed**
*Missing that functionality critical fail...*

DM adventure log "cards" in the Adventure log can now clear once a user rolls
    - direct roll prompts clear once the player succesfully rolls
    - if a direct roll prompt is cancelled by the DM
    - prompt all initiative card will clear only if DM clicks clear all active prompts

Rolls can now be for advantage/disadvantage
Also added support for 2 dice
removed the raw roll value out of player roll messages so pre-calculated values are omitted
resized the action dice modal UI to fit 1080p displays (just about!)

added a lobby
- lobby will show all active people, regardless of being in the party
- lobby wont also show if youre in the party
- lobby will now show disconnected users
