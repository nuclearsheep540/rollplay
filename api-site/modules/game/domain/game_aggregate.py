    Game Aggregate Root

    Stores high level game state and manages invite/join workflow.
    Game is independent from Campaign - Campaign only references Game by ID.

    Invite/Join Workflow (Updated):
    1. DM invites User → added to invited_users (pending)
    2. User accepts invite → moved to joined_users (roster)
    3. User selects Character → character association tracked in game_joined_users table
    4. User enters session → character added to active_session (MongoDB)

    Key Concepts:
    - invited_users: Users with pending invites (not yet accepted)
    - joined_users: Users who accepted invite (game roster)
    - Character association: Tracked separately in game_joined_users table
    - Active session: Handled by api-game service (MongoDB)
